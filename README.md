# FTC-Autonomous-Opmode
This repository contains a collection of advanced algorithms for FTC robots, including odometry, sensor fusion, curved movement, and autonomous programming, all incorporating Kalman filtering. These algorithms can be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of FTC robots during competitions.

## FTC Autonomous Opmode
This project contains an autonomous opmode for a robot competing in the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC). The opmode is designed to perform complex movements while maintaining accurate position tracking using odometry and sensor fusion techniques.

Overview
The opmode is built using a combination of several advanced mathematical concepts, including multivariable calculus, arc length parametrization, Kalman filtering, and sensor fusion. By incorporating these techniques, the robot is able to accurately track its position and orientation on the field, and perform complex movements such as arcs and circles.

The opmode is split into several classes, each of which handles a specific aspect of the robot's behavior. Robot.java defines the physical characteristics and behaviors of the robot, while Odometry.java uses calculus to accurately track its position and orientation. SensorFusion.java combines data from the robot's IMU and odometry sensors to provide a more accurate estimation of its position and orientation, while CurvedMovement.java adds the ability to perform curved movements. AutonomousMasterCode.java ties together all of these components to create a comprehensive autonomous opmode.

Usage
To use this opmode, follow these steps:

Connect all required hardware components, including the robot controller phone, expansion hub, motors and servos, encoder sensors, and IMU sensor.
Initialize the robot's starting position in the opmode. This can be done using either manual measurements or a field positioning system such as Vuforia or Tensorflow.
Run AutonomousMasterCode.java on your FTC robot. The robot will then perform the programmed movements autonomously.
During operation, the robot will use its sensors to continually track its position and orientation, and adjust its movements accordingly. The opmode includes several predefined movements, but can be easily modified to perform custom tasks as needed.

Dependencies
This opmode requires the following components:

FTC SDK
Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 8+
Robot controller phone
Expansion hub
Motors and servos
Encoder sensors
IMU sensor
